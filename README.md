# 📘 Multi-Document Q/&A WebApp

A web application that lets you **upload, manage, and query multiple documents** using a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline.

Users can upload files, rename/delete them, and ask natural-language questions to retrieve answers grounded in the document content.
